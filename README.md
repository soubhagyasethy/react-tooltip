# react-tooltip
Coding Ninjas skill test: 
- Create a simple tooltip component such that when I hover over a button it shows me a tooltip.
- The component will receive the ‘position‘ of tooltip as prop. We can pass options : “top”, “bottom”, “right”, “left”.
- According to the position the tooltip should render at that position.
- You are ALLOWED to style the switch the way you like. Do whatever you want with the styling. ONLY the functionality of the component should work.
